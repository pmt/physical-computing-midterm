# Midterm IoT Project

Name:  PATRICIA TORVALDS pmt / pmt15

Date: 10.11.17

## Project: TRASH CLOUDS

### Conceptual Description

My project in conjunction with @tracylooloo engages in the ideas of e-waste. While Tracy Lu's project is a trash can, mine represents the physical fallout of electronic waste in the form of a "toxic cloud"/"trash cloud" actually made of 3D printer scraps. The trash cloud is filled with red and yellow LED lights which turn on when either someone presses the button on my piece, or when someone removes the lid of Tracy's trash can. Often, software users end their interactions with so-called trash at the end of an electronic's lifespan; my piece extends that lifespan and makes trash visible.
### Form
